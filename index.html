        <h2>What is Drought?</h2>
        <p>Drought is a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall or water shortage, leading to a shortage of water resources. It can have severe impacts on ecosystems, agriculture, and human communities.</p>

        <h2>Types of Drought</h2>
        <p>There are different types of drought, including meteorological drought (lack of rainfall), agricultural drought (impact on crops), hydrological drought (low water levels in rivers and reservoirs), and socioeconomic drought (impact on communities).</p>

        <h2>Causes of Drought</h2>
        <p>Drought can be caused by various factors, including climate change, natural variability, overuse of water resources, and deforestation. Understanding the causes is crucial for effective drought management.</p>

        <h2>Drought Impacts</h2>
        <p>Drought can have far-reaching consequences, such as crop failure, water scarcity, food shortages, and economic hardship. It also affects ecosystems, leading to wildfires and habitat loss.</p>

        <h2>Drought Management</h2>
        <p>Efficient drought management involves water conservation, sustainable agriculture practices, early warning systems, and government policies to mitigate its effects and protect vulnerable populations.</p>
